# How it works

SR04 Ultrasonic sensor continously calculates the distance from the top of the bin to the bottom.

If the distance is less than 90% of the previous distance then sound will be played, time logged in a file and the ammount of uses are incremented.

sounds are named from 0 to 100 (whatever the max value is) and iterated through.

eventually socket programming will be used to send when the sensor has been triggered and that data will be graphed and put onto a website.
